\begin{abstract}
  The upcoming Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) radiometer, to be launched on board the
  second generation of European operational meteorological satellites
  (Metop-SG), will be the first microwave imager to provide sub-millimeter
  observations of the atmosphere. The Microwave Imager (MWI) radiometer will be
  flown on the same satellites and complement the ICI sensor with observations
  at traditional millimeter wavelengths. The addition of these two new passive
  microwave sensors to the global system of earth observation satellites opens
  up opportunities for synergistic satellite missions aiming to maximize
  the scientific return of the Metop-SG program. This study analyzes the
  potential benefits of combining observations of the MWI and ICI radiometers
  with a 94-$\unit{GHz}$ cloud radar for the retrieval of frozen hydrometeors.
  Starting from a simplified numerical experiment, it is shown that the
  complementary information content in the radar and radiometer observations can
  help to better constrain the particle size distribution of ice particles in
  the atmosphere. The feasibility of the combined retrieval is demonstrated by
  applying a one-dimensional, variational cloud-retrieval algorithm to simulated
  observations from a high-resolution atmospheric model. Comparison of the
  results with passive- and radar-only versions of the retrieval algorithm
  confirms that synergies between the active and passive observations allow an
  improved retrieval of microphysical properties of frozen hydrometeors. The
  effect of the assumed ice particle shape on the results is analyzed and found
  to be critical for obtaining good retrieval performance. In addition to this,
  the synergistic retrieval shows improved sensitivity to liquid water in both
  warm and supercooled clouds. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the
  potential of the combined observations to constrain the microphysical
  properties of ice hydrometeors, which can help to reduce errors in retrieved
  profiles of mass- and number densities.\end{abstract}


\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

Ice clouds play an important role in many weather- and climate-related processes
in the atmosphere. They interact with incoming and outgoing radiation and thus
influence the Earth's energy budget. Moreover, as part of the global
hydrological cycle and due to their relation to the dynamics of the atmosphere
\citep{bony15}, observations of ice clouds provide important information to
constrain the state of the atmosphere in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models
\citep{geer} as well as to validate predictions from climate models
\citep{waliser09}.

Despite the importance of observations of ice clouds for climate and weather
prediction, today's global observing system cannot provide accurate information
on the global distribution of ice in the atmosphere
\citep{eliasson11,duncan18a}. The main difficulty in sensing atmospheric ice
from space is the large variability of sizes and concentrations in which ice
particles occur in the atmosphere. The wide spectrum of ice crystal sizes, which
ranges from micro- to millimeter scales, can only be partially resolved by
currently available space-borne sensors.

The sensitivity of a remote sensing system to ice particles of a given size is
determined mainly by its observing frequencies. The scattering of radiation by
ice particles is strongest for sizes roughly equal to the wavelength, $\lambda$,
of the radiation. For particles with sizes much smaller than $\lambda$, the
sensitivity decreases rapidly, making them practically invisible to the sensor.
Although the strength of the interaction between particles and radiation
decreases as the wavelength becomes much larger than the particle size, it
remains strong enough for the cloud signal to saturate in the presence of
thicker clouds, leading to loss of sensitivity further down the line of sight.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The observing frequencies that are currently available for measuring ice from
space are limited to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Currently available systems for observing ice hydrometeors typically make use of
radiation from }\DIFaddend the microwave, infrared \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or }\DIFaddend optical domain. Infrared and optical
sensors provide sensitivity to small ice particles but cannot sense significant
parts of the ice mass of thicker clouds due to saturation of the signal.
Microwave observations, in contrast, provide sensitivity throughout the whole
atmospheric column but are insensitive to small ice particles. Although radars
and lidars generally provide greater sensitivity than their passive
counterparts, they are ultimately limited by the same principles.

To narrow the size-sensitivity gap between the infrared and traditional microwave
sensors, the upcoming Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) will extend the microwave
frequencies available for studying clouds with channels at $243$, $325$, $448$ and
$664\ \unit{GHz}$ \citep{Eriksson19}. This extension of the smallest currently available microwave
wavelength from $1.6\ \unit{mm}$ at $183\ \unit{GHz}$ down to the sub-millimeter
domain ($0.45\ \unit{mm}$ at $664\ \unit{GHz}$) will significantly improve the
size-sensitivity of space-borne microwave observations of clouds.

Together with ICI, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{also }\DIFdelend the newly developed Microwave Imager (MWI) will be flown on
the satellites of the Metop-SG program. MWI will complement ICI's observations
with measurements at traditional millimeter wavelengths \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as well as a novel
spectral band around the $118\ \unit{GHz}$ Oxygen line}\DIFaddend . The observations of MWI,
which cover the frequency range from $19\ \unit{GHz}$ up to $183\ \unit{GHz}$,
will provide additional sensitivity to liquid and frozen precipitation as well
as water vapor.

The advent of space-borne sub-millimeter radiometry of clouds brings with it
great potential for the study \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend ice in the atmosphere. The information content and
retrieval performance \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend radiometer observations alone has been studied in
detail for column-integrated ice mass \citep{jimenez07, wang17, brath18a} as
well as for the vertical distribution of ice in the atmosphere \citep{birman17, grutzun18,
  aires19}. Also the concept of combining millimeter and sub-millimeter
radiometer observations with active observations from a cloud radar has been
investigated \citep{evans05, jiang19}.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Combined retrievals using radar and passive radiometer observations, have also
been developed for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM,
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{kummerow98, grecu04}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM,
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{hou14, grecu16, munchak11}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
) mission. However, since the principal target
of these missions were liquid hydrometeors, they make use of sensors at
comparably low microwave frequencies, which provide only limited sensitivity to
frozen hydrometeors.
}

\DIFaddend This work applies the concept of synergistic radar and sub-millimeter radiometer
retrievals to the upcoming ICI and MWI sensors by combining them with a
conceptual\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, nadir-pointing }\DIFaddend W-band cloud radar. It extends previous studies on
this observational technique by providing an in-depth analysis of the
fundamental synergies between the active and passive observations that help to
improve the retrieval ice in the atmosphere. In particular, this study
investigates to which extent the combined active and passive observations can
constrain the microphysics of ice particles in the atmosphere. Starting from a
simplified numerical experiment, the complementarity of the information content
of the active and passive observations is demonstrated. In addition to this,
simulated results from a synergistic, variational cloud-retrieval algorithm are
presented. The algorithm is applied to synthetic observations of cloud scenes
from a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{high-resolution
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cloud-resolving }\DIFaddend atmospheric model and used to further explore the
synergies between the active and passive observations.

The presented research has been conducted as part of a larger study funded by
the European Space Agency, which evaluated the concept of a future radar mission
to fly in constellation with ICI on board the satellites of the Metop-SG
program. Inspired by the concept of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM,
\cite{hou14}) mission, the approach of this tentative mission is to perform
vertically-resolved, high-accuracy retrievals of hydrometeors from the
co-located active and passive observations at the swath center of the passive
imager. The results of combined retrieval could then be used to constrain
passive-only profile retrievals with the aim of extending the profiling
capabilities of the radar to the wide swath of the passive imager.

Following this introduction, Section \ref{sec:methods_and_data} introduces the
test data, sensor configuration and the developed retrieval algorithm on which
the study is based. This is followed by the experimental results on the
information content of the combined observations and the retrieval results of
the joint retrieval on selected test scenes in Section \ref{sec:results}. The
article closes with a discussion of the results in Section \ref{sec:discussion}
and conclusions in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}.


\section{Methods and data}
\label{sec:methods_and_data}

The synergistic retrieval is tested using simulated observations of cloud scenes
from a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{high-resolution }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{cloud-resolving }\DIFaddend atmospheric circulation model. This section presents the
selected reference cloud scenes, sensor configuration and basic modeling
assumptions used in the radiative transfer simulations. In addition to this, the
theoretical formulation of the combined cloud-retrieval algorithm is introduced.

\subsection{Reference cloud scenes}

The cloud scenes that will be used for the testing of the retrieval were
produced by Environment and Climate Change Canada using a high-resolution NWP
configuration of the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) Model
(\cite{cote98}). For this study, we restrict ourselves to two designated,
two-dimensional test scenes, which are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}. The
test scenes have a horizontal resolution of $1\ \unit{km}$ and both extend over
$800\ \unit{km}$. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scenes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{vertical resolution of the model scenes varies between 250
and $500\ \unit{m}$ below an altitude of $18\ \unit{km}$ and decreases
steadily above that. The scenes }\DIFaddend were chosen with the aim of covering a large
range of cloud structures and compositions so as to ensure a realistic
assessment of the retrieval. The first test scene, shown in panel (a), is
located in the tropical Pacific and contains a convective storm system in the
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{right }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{northern }\DIFaddend half of the scene and its anvil that extends into the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{left }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{southern }\DIFaddend half of
the scene. The second scene, shown in panel (b), is located in the North
Atlantic and contains an ice cloud in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{first quarter }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{southern part }\DIFaddend and a low-level,
mixed-phase cloud in the remainder of the scene.

\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{figures/fig01.png}
\caption{The distribution of total hydrometeor mass content in the two
cloud scenes used to test the retrieval. Colored lines show the
 $m = 10^{-5}\  \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$ contour for different
 hydrometeor species.}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

The GEM model uses \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a two-moment scheme with }\DIFaddend six types of hydrometeors to
represent clouds and precipitation \citep{milbrandtyau05}: Two classes of liquid
hydrometeors (rain and liquid cloud) and four of frozen hydrometeors (cloud ice,
snow, hail and graupel). The particle size distribution (PSD) of each
hydrometeor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{type is parametrized by its particle number concentration and mass density. The
full
particle size distributioncan be prognosed from the two moments using a
species-dependent parametrization and
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{class is described by a three-parameter gamma distribution. The
prognostic parameters of the two-moment scheme are the slope and intercept
parameters of the distribution, which are derived from the mixing ratios and
number densities predicted by the GEM model. The third parameter of the PSD and
the }\DIFaddend mass-size relationship \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of each hydrometeor class are set to fixed,
class-specific values}\DIFaddend . The parameters of the mass-size \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{relationship }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{relationships }\DIFaddend are given
in Tab.~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{tab:species_parameters}. As
shown in the table, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{tab:partice_properties}. The }\DIFaddend masses of all ice particles in the
model are assumed to scale with a power of three, which leads to high densities
for large particles.

    \citet{eriksson18} scattering database.}
  \label{tab:species_parameters}
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c}

    Snow         & GemSnow      & 32 & 52.4  & 3 \\

    Liquid cloud & LiquidSphere & 25 & 523.6 & 3 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Examples of particle size distributions of frozen hydrometeors are displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:gem_psds}. The four panels display the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{prognosed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{derived }\DIFaddend particle size
distributions for the four frozen hydrometeor types together with renderings of
the particle shapes used in the forward simulations. As these plots show, the
assumed particle size distributions across different ice species vary mostly in
their \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{horizontal and vertical scaling }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{scaling with respect to size and concentration}\DIFaddend , whereas the function shape shows less
variability. Furthermore, an important characteristic of the model can be
identified here, which will help to better understand the retrieval results
presented later: Cloud ice in the model is characterized by high particle number
densities and small particle sizes, whereas snow exhibits lower number
concentrations and larger particles.

  $10^{-6}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$. Line color encodes the corresponding mass density.}

\end{figure}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In order to simulate microwave observations of the GEM model scenes the hydrometeor
classes in the model must be associated with particle models that define their
radiometric properties. The ARTS single-scattering database contains particle
models that were designed to be consistent with the assumed shape and mass-size
relationships made in the GEM microphysics scheme. Rain and liquid cloud drops
are modeled as liquid spheres. The properties of the particle models used
for the frozen hydrometeor types are listed together with their parameters
in Ta..~\ref{tab:species_parameters}.
}

\DIFaddend \subsection{Simulated cloud observations}

A simulated observation is generated for each vertical profile in the
model test scenes. The simulations apply the same microphysics scheme
as the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{model}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GEM test scenes}\DIFaddend , which means that they use the same six hydrometeor classes
and PSD parametrizations.

\subsubsection{Sensor configuration}
\label{sec:sensors}

Simulations of observed passive brightness temperatures are performed for the 11
highest-frequency channels of the MWI radiometer and all channels of the ICI
radiometer. The passive observations are combined with a W-band cloud radar
similar to the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{)
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{stephens02,tanelli08}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{stephens02,tanelli08}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
)}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{A }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In order to reduce the complexity of generating simulated observations, a }\DIFaddend number
of simplifications are applied \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for the generation of the synthetic
cloud observations: Firstly, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to the viewing geometry and the radiative
transfer modeling. The }\DIFaddend beams of all three sensors are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{modeled as
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{assumed to point at nadir
and to be }\DIFaddend perfectly coincident pencil beams. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Secondly, a synthetic observation is
generated for each vertical profile from the
model scenes by simulating a one-dimensional, plane-parallel atmosphere, the properties of which are taken
from the corresponding model profile. It follows from these modeling decisions
that the atmosphere is assumed to be homogeneous across the
beams of the active
and passive sensorsand that they all sense the same atmospheric volume. This is
certainly not }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In this way, observations for }\DIFaddend the
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{case for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GEM model scenes can be simulated by performing a single 1-dimensional radiative
transfer calculation for each profile. Moreover, multiple scattering effects in
the radar observations are neglected. The simulations therefore do not take into
account beam filling effects caused by atmospheric inhomogeneity across the
footprints of the different sensors. The incidence angles of the beams of ICI
and MWI will be around $53^\circ$ at the Earth's surface, so the simulations
performed here do not represent the viewing geometry of a }\DIFaddend space-borne
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{observations and will incur a forward
modeling error that is not accounted for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{configuration involving ICI and MWI accurately. Realistic modeling of the
viewing geometry as well as multiple scattering effects in a variational
retrieval are currently not feasible at reasonable computational cost with the
tools used }\DIFaddend in this study. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Assuming observations at nadir further allows neglecting
polarization effects, which can be several Kelvin at typical viewing geometries
of imager sensors \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{xie15}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFaddend Since the focus of this study are the fundamental
synergies between the active and passive observations, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{quantifying the impact of beam width and inhomogeneity is left for future
investigation. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Observations from the ICI radiometer are simulated by performing a single, non-polarized radiative transfer simulation located at the centers of the pass
bands of each channel and averaging the resulting brightness temperatures. For
channels with multiple polarizations, only a single simulation is performed.
To compensate for
this, the noise of the corresponding channel is reduced by a
factor of $\sqrt{2}$. The simulated ICI channels and assumed noise levels are
presented in  Tab.~\ref{tab:channels}. The off-nadir viewing angle of ICI
is assumed to be $48\unit{^\circ}$ at the sensor}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this was deemed
sufficient for its scope. Moreover, these assumptions are justifiable for
air-borne observations, which adds practical relevance to the simulations}\DIFaddend .

Observations from the MWI radiometer are simulated in a similar manner as those
from ICI. However, from MWI only channels with frequencies larger than or equal
to $89\ \unit{GHz}$ are used. The reason for this is that the footprints of the
channels with frequencies lower than $89\ \unit{GHz}$ have full-width at half
maximum of $50\ \unit{km}$ compared to only $10\ \unit{km}$ for the
higher-frequency channels. Due to the very small overlap of the footprints of
these low-frequency channels with that of the radar, it is assumed they would
not be beneficial for a synergistic retrieval and are therefore disregarded
here. The included MWI channels are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:channels}.

The frequency of the the cloud radar is chosen to be $94\ \unit{GHz}$ similar to
CloudSat CPR. The vertical resolution of the radar observations is assumed to be
$500\ \unit{m}$ ranging from $0.5$ to $20\ \unit{km}$ in altitude. The minimum
sensitivity is set to be $-30\ \unit{dBZ}$ and the noise at each range gate is
modeled to be independent with standard deviation $0.5\ \unit{dBZ}$. As mentioned
above, the same incidence angle as for the passive radiometers is assumed also
for the radar. In practice, this could be achieved by remapping the radar
observations to the lines of sights of the passive beams.

\subsubsection{Radiative transfer simulations}
\label{sec:orge741b86}

All simulations presented in this study were performed using Version 2.3.1245 of
the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS, \cite{arts18}). Radar
reflectivities are computed using ARTS' built-in single-scattering radar solver\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
which provides analytic Jacobians}\DIFaddend . For the simulation of passive radiances, a
hybrid solver is used which combines the DISORT \citep{disort00} scattering
solver with the ARTS standard scheme for pencil beam radiative transfer. The
hybrid solver has been added to ARTS specifically for this study and provides
approximate, analytical Jacobians, which are required for the variational
retrievals of hydrometeors. All simulations are performed assuming an ocean
surface with emissivities calculated using the Tool to Estimate Sea‐Surface
Emissivity from Microwaves to sub‐Millimeter waves (TESSEM, \cite{prigent16}).
Polarization is neglected in all simulations performed in this study. Particle
scattering data are taken from the ARTS scattering data base (hereafter ARTS
SSDB, \citet{eriksson18}). Gaseous absorption is modeled using the absorption
models from \cite{rosenkranz93} for $N_2$, $O_2$ and from \cite{rosenkranz98}
for $H_2O$.


\subsection{Retrieval algorithm}
\label{sec:orgb528563}

A one-dimensional, variational cloud retrieval algorithm is proposed to
retrieve distributions of frozen hydrometeors from the combined active and
passive observations. The algorithm uses the optimal estimation method (OEM)
developed by \cite{rodgers00}. The retrieved state $\mathbf{x} \in
   \mathbb{R}^n$ is determined by fitting a forward model $\mathbf{F} : \mathbb{R}^n
   \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ to a set of observations $\mathbf{y} \in
   \mathbb{R}^m$. The best fit is determined by minimizing a cost function of
the form
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) \propto
 \left(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{y} \right )^T
  \mathbf{S}_e^{-1} 
  \left ( \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{y} \right)
+ \left ( \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_a \right )^T
 \mathbf{S}^{-1}_a 
 \left ( \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_a \right ).
\end{align}
%
The cost function $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ corresponds to the negative
log-likelihood of the a posteriori distribution of the state $\mathbf{x}$ under
the assumptions of Gaussian a priori distribution with mean $\mathbf{x}_a$ and
covariance matrix $\mathbf{S}_a$ as well as zero-mean Gaussian measurement error
with covariance matrix $\mathbf{S}_e$.

To assess the quality of a retrieved state $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ and corresponding simulated
observation $\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{F}(\hat{\mathbf{x}})$, we define the following diagnostic
quantity
\begin{align}
\chi^2_y &= \delta \mathbf{y}^T
  \mathbf{S}_e^{-1} 
  \delta \mathbf{y},
\end{align}
where $\delta \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{y} - \hat{\mathbf{y}}$. The quantity
$\chi^2_y$   \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is here used to approximate a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{corresponds to the squared error in the fitted observations
weighted by the uncertainties in each channel. It should be noted that
the quantity has no meaningful interpretation in terms of }\DIFaddend $\chi^2$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{-test for the misfit between
the observations $\mathbf{y}$ and the retrieval fit $\hat{\mathbf{y}}$. Although
a formally correct $\chi^2$-test for $\delta\mathbf{y}$ should apply a different
covariance matrix }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{-statistic
for the errors in the fitted observations since they will neither be independent
}\DIFaddend (c.f. Chapter~12 in \cite{rodgers00}) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, such tests were found
to yield very high values that deviate strongly from the expected chi-square
distribution. The $\chi^2_y$ value used here provides a less strict test in the sense that it will generally be smaller than if the
formally correct covariance
matrix was used}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{nor Gaussian due to the presence of forward
model error. The value is used here as a heuristic to quantify the goodness of the
fit to the true observations}\DIFaddend .

The amount of information contained in a retrieval can be quantified by
computing the degrees of freedom for signal (DFS). Let $\mathbf{K} \in
\mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be the Jacobian of the forward model $\mathbf{F}$. Then
the DFS of the observations can be computed as the trace of the averaging kernel
matrix
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{A} &=(\mathbf{K}^T\mathbf{S}_e^{-1}\mathbf{K} + \mathbf{S}_a^{-1})^{-1}
  \mathbf{K}^T\mathbf{S}_e^{-1}\mathbf{K}.
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Measurement space}
\label{sec:orge7dc286}

The input for the retrieval algorithm is the combined observation vector
$\mathbf{y}$ consisting of the concatenated single-instrument observations from
the cloud radar and the two radiometers. Measurement errors are assumed to be
independent and Gaussian distributed with standard deviations according to the
noise characteristics given in Section \ref{sec:sensors}.

The plot displays the a-priori-assumed shapes of the particle size distribution
of frozen and liquid hydrometeors. The retrieved horizontal and vertical scaling
parameters, $D_m$ and $N_0^*$, are used as units for the axes of the plot so

the values of the shape parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are chosen identical to
version 3 of the DARDAR-CLOUD product \citep{cazenave18}. For liquid
hydrometeors, the shape parameters are chosen so that they are equivalent to the
shape used by the GEM model for rain drops.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{All calculations involving particles size distributions

\DIFdelend The temperature-dependent a priori profile for $N_0^*$ of frozen
hydrometeors is determined using the relation from \cite{delanoe14}
%
\begin{align}
N_0^* &= \exp \left ( -0.076586 \cdot (T - 272.5) + 17.948 \right ),
\end{align}
%
where $T$ is in $\unit{K}$. The a priori profile for $D_m$ for frozen
hydrometeors is chosen so that the a priori mass density is equal to
$10^{-6}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$. For liquid hydrometeors, a fixed value for $N_0^*$
of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$10^6\ \unit{m^4}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$10^6\ \unit{m^-4}$ }\DIFaddend is assumed and the a priori profile for $D_m$ is
determined similarly as for frozen hydrometeors. Values of the mass-weighted
mean diameter $D_m$ for both hydrometeor species are retrieved in linear space,
whereas the normalized number concentration parameter $N_0^*$ is retrieved in
$\text{log}_{10}$ space. As additional constraints, the retrieval of frozen
hydrometeors is restricted to the region between the freezing layer\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, here
defined simply as the $273.15\ \unit{K}$-isotherm, }\DIFaddend and the tropopause, whereas
the retrieval of liquid hydrometeors is restricted to below the freezing layer.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The location of the tropopause is approximated as the first grid point at which
the lapse rate is negative and the temperature is below $220\ \unit{K}$.
}\DIFaddend 

To further regularize the retrieval, $N_0^*$ for ice is retrieved at only 10
equally-spaced grid points between freezing layer and the tropopause. Similarly,
$D_m$ and $N_0^*$ for rain are retrieved at 10 respectively 4 points between surface and
freezing layer. This was necessary \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to avoid the retrieval from }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the retrieval to avoid }\DIFaddend getting stuck in
spurious local minima. An approach similar to this one is also taken in the GPM
combined precipitation retrievals \citep{grecu16}.

Humidity in the atmospheric column is retrieved in units of relative humidity at
a vertical resolution of $1\ \unit{km}$. However, instead of retrieving relative
humidity directly, an inverse hyperbolic tangens transformation is applied to
the relative humidity profile $\mathbf{\phi}$:
%
\begin{align}
x = \text{arctanh}(\frac{2 \mathbf{\phi}}{1.1} - 1.0)
\end{align}
%
The transformation restricts the retrieved relative humidity values to
the range of $[0.0, 1.1]$. The a priori profile for relative humidity
is arbitrarily chosen as
%
\begin{align}
\phi(t) = \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \begin{cases}
%DIFDELCMD <  0.7 &, 270\ \unit{K} < t \\
%DIFDELCMD <  0.7 - 0.01 \cdot (t - 270) & ,220 < t \leq  270\ \unit{K} \\
%DIFDELCMD <  0.2 \cdot (t - 270) & ,t < 220 \\
%DIFDELCMD <  \end{cases}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \begin{cases}
 0.7 &, 270\ \unit{K} < t \\
 0.7 - 0.01 \cdot (270 -t) & ,220 < t \leq  270\ \unit{K} \\
 0.2 \cdot 220 ,t < 220 \unit{K} \\
 \end{cases}\DIFaddend .
\end{align}
%
The retrieval of liquid cloud mass density, here referred to as liquid water
content (LWC), is performed at seven equally spaced altitude levels between the
surface and the $230\ \unit{K}$ isotherm. In contrast to frozen and liquid
hydrometeors, cloud water is modeled in the retrieval forward model to be purely
absorbing using the absorption model by \cite{liebe93} for suspended liquid
cloud droplets. Liquid cloud mass density is retrieved in
$\text{log}_{10}$-space and the a priori profile is set to a fixed value of
$10^{-6}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$ in the permitted region of the atmosphere.

The a priori distributions of the 6 retrieval quantities ($N_0^*$ and $D_m$ for
frozen and liquid hydrometeors, relative humidity $\phi$, cloud water) are
assumed to be independent so that the overall a priori covariance matrix
$\mathbf{S}_a$ has block-diagonal structure. Within each block, vertical
correlations between the values of a given retrieval quantity at different
altitudes are assumed to be exponentially decaying. Hence, the correlation of
the values of retrieval quantity $q$ at points $i$ and $j$ of the retrieval grid
is computed as
%
\begin{align}
\left ( \mathbf{S}_{a,q} \right )_{i, j} &= \sigma_{q,i} \sigma_{q,j}
 \cdot \exp  \left ( -\frac{d(i, j)}{l_q} \right ),
\end{align}
%
where $\sigma_{q, i}$ is the a priori uncertainty assumed for retrieval
quantity $q$ at grid point $i$, $d(i, j)$ the distance between the grid
points and $l_q$ the quantity-specific correlation length. The assumed
a priori uncertainties and correlation lengths for the retrieval quantities
are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:a_priori}.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{A priori uncertainties and correlation
 lengths used in the retrieval.}

    \hline
    $\log_{10}(N_{0, \text{frozen}}^*)$    & $2$                       & $5$ \\
    $D_{m, \text{ice}}$               & $300\ \unit{\mu m}$          & $5$ \\

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

As baselines for the assessment of the combined retrieval, also a radar-only and
a passive only-retrieval are performed. The radar-only retrieval uses the same
implementation as the combined retrieval, but only retrieves frozen and liquid
hydrometeors. For the radar-only retrieval, perfect knowledge of the atmospheric
humidity profile is assumed but liquid cloud is ignored in the retrieval forward
model.

The setup and retrieval quantities of the passive-only retrieval are similar to
the combined retrieval, with the only difference being that frozen and liquid
hydrometeors are retrieved at reduced resolution. For ice, $N_0^*$ is retrieved
at three equally spaced grid points between freezing layer and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{troposphere}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tropopause}\DIFaddend , while
$D_m$ is retrieved at five. For liquid hydormeteors, the retrieval grids for
$N_0^*$ and $D_m$ are reduced to two equally spaced points between surface and
freezing layer. Relative humidity is retrieved at a vertical resolution of
$2\ \unit{km}$.

\DIFaddbegin \subsubsection{\DIFadd{Particle models}}

\DIFadd{Since the retrieval uses only a single species of frozen hydrometeors it is
desirable to find an ice particle model that can represent the multiple classes

observations. For our experiments a set of five ice particle models has been

\DIFaddend \section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The first part of this section presents results from a numerical experiment 
that investigates the complementary information content of the active and passive
microwave observations. Results of the combined  and the baseline retrievals applied
to the reference cloud scenes are presented in the remaining part of this section.

\subsection{Complementary information content}
\label{sec:simple_cloud}

A fundamental question regarding the benefit of combining two remote sensing
observations in a retrieval is to what extent the observations contain
non-redundant information. The degree of non-redundancy in the combined
observations is what we refer to here as complementary information content.
In order to explore this complementary information content in the radar and
radiometer observations, an idealized, homogeneous cloud layer with a thickness
of $4\ \unit{km}$ located at an altitude of $10\ \unit{km}$ in a tropical
atmosphere is considered. The cloud is assumed to consist of a single species of
frozen hydrometeors represented using the PSD parametrization which is also used
in the retrieval and described in Sec.~\ref{sec:method:fowardmodel}. As particle
model, the 8-ColumnAggregate (ID 8) from the ARTS SSDB is used.

The question that is addressed here is whether the combination of active and
passive observations is able to constrain both the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{horizontal and the
vertical scaling factors of the
PSD of the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{size and concentration of the
}\DIFaddend ice particles in the cloud. To investigate this, the $N_0^*$ and $D_m$
parameters of the homogeneous cloud layer are varied and observations of the
cloud layer are simulated. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure
\ref{fig:contours} displays the simulated }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend passive cloud signal \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, i.e. the
brightness
temperature difference between clear sky and cloudy sky simulation, as filled
contours for a selection of channels of the MWI and ICI sensors. For given
values of $N_0^*$ and $D_m$, the corresponding ice mass density is given by
the relation
}\begin{eqnarray*}
\DIFdel{m = \frac{\pi \rho}{4 ^ 4}N_0^* D_m^4.
}\end{eqnarray*}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{In the figure, the cloud signal is displayed in $D_m$-mass density space and
thus shows how the measured

vertical scaling parameters of the PSD. Overlaid onto }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{($\Delta T_B$) is the

}\begin{align}
\DIFadd{m = \frac{\pi \rho}{4 ^ 4}N_0^* D_m^4,
}\end{align}
\DIFadd{where, $\rho$ is the density of ice}\DIFaddend .

\end{figure}

The contours of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the measured active and passive cloud signals }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\Delta T_B$ and $\text{dBZ}_\text{max}$  }\DIFaddend show the ambiguity
of the single-instrument \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{measurements }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{observations }\DIFaddend with respect to the parameters of the PSD:
Along these contours the signal does not change, while the cloud composition
does. A necessary condition for a combined cloud retrieval to be able to resolve
this ambiguity is that the contours of the active and passive signals cross each
other. The panels in Fig.~\ref{fig:contours} thus provide an indication to what
extent the information in the radar measurement and the corresponding passive
radiometer channel provide complementary information on the parameters of the
PSD. Considering the panels corresponding to the MWI channels, the results show
that the observations contain complementary information only for very dense
clouds consisting of very large particles. In contrast to that, the ICI
observations exhibit crossing contours already at lower $m$ and $D_m$ values,
indicating that the complementary information content in these observations is
higher for less dense clouds consisting of smaller particles.

\subsection{Retrieval results}

To assess the performance of the combined cloud retrieval, the developed
algorithm has been applied to the two designated cloud scenes. The same
retrievals have been performed with a radar-only and a passive-only version of
the algorithm to serve as baselines for the combined retrieval. Each retrieval
was performed multiple times using different ice particle models. The tested
particle shapes are listed together with the corresponding mass size relations
and ARTS SSDB identifier in Tab.~\ref{tab:particles_retrieval}. Since the
results for both test scenes are qualitatively similar, not all analyses are
shown for both scenes. Instead, these are provided as a digital supplement to
this article.

The forward-simulated observations that were generated to test the retrievals
are shown for the first test scene in Fig.~\ref{fig:observations_a}. Independent
Gaussian noise with standard deviations according to sensor specifications has
been added to the simulated observations to account for sensor noise. It is
important to note, that the simulated observations which are used to test the
retrieval assume different microphysics than what is assumed in the retrieval:
The synthetic observations are computed using the six hydrometeor classes from
the GEM model, while the retrieval forward model assumes only two classes of
hydrometeors.

To make the assessment of the retrieval performance more quantitative, the
reference mass concentrations are plotted against the retrieved values in
Fig.~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{fig:results_scatter_a_1} and \ref{fig:results_scatter_a_2}. The plots
show the results for all different retrieval configurations and tested
particle models. Markers in the plots are color-coded according to the prevailing hydrometeor type (by mass density) in the reference scene in order
to allow assessment of the retrieval performance for the different hydrometeor
types of the GEM model }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:results_scatter_a}. In terms of precision, the passive
only retrieval performs worst while both the radar-only and combined retrieval
yield much smaller spread of the retrieved values from the diagonal. This
is not surprising since the passive-only retrieval does not contain sufficient
information on the vertical distribution of IWC to yield accurate results
at the resolution of the model scenes}\DIFaddend .

Not surprisingly, the results from the
passive-only retrieval exhibit the strongest deviations from the diagonal. Since
the passive channels alone contain only limited information on the vertical
distribution of ice in the atmosphere, the retrieval cannot be expected to yield
accurate results at the resolution considered here. Although rather weak, a
certain effect of the ice particle model on the retrieval results can be
observed. In particular, the GemCloudIce model leads to a systematic
underestimation of ice mass densities, which are less pronounced for the other
particle models.

densities for cloud ice but overestimates the mass density of snow. The effect

in this scene is located where the radar signal is fully attenuated. Since there

To summarize retrieval performance for all tested retrieval methods and particle
shapes, the logarithmic error
\begin{align}
  \text{E}_{\text{log}_{10}} &= \log_\text{10} \left (\frac{x_\text{retrieved}}{x_\text{reference}} \right )
\end{align}
for the retrieved IWC and IWP are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:boxes}. The
logarithmic error in the IWC retrieval has been computed only for grid points
where either reference or retrieved IWC is larger than
$10^{-6}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$. Considering first the results of the IWC
retrieval, shown in Panel~(a) and (b), the plots confirm the findings from the
analysis above: The combined retrieval generally yields the smallest retrieval
errors. Although the spread of the retrieval errors of the radar-only retrieval
is lower in the second scene, the combined retrieval yields smaller systematic
errors.

Compared in terms of IWP, however, the results are different. Especially the
passive-only retrieval yields much lower errors for the retrieved IWP, making
the results comparable if not better than those of the other methods. For the
radar-only and combined retrievals the precision is generally increased but
systematic deviations observed in the IWC persist. This leads, particularly for
the second test scene, to significant systematic errors in the
radar-only-retrieved IWP.

In addition to this, the passive-only and the combined retrieval exhibit a
strong dependence of the retrieval error on the applied particle model.
Especially the GemCloudIce and GemSnow particle models yield large retrieval
errors for IWC and IWP. The other three particle models, however, consistently
yield smaller retrieval than the GemCloudIce and GemSnow models.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Particle number densities}

Particle number densities of frozen hydrometeors have been derived from the
retrieved $N_0^*$ and $D_m$ parameters by computing the zeroth moment of the
corresponding PSD. The resulting particle number density fields are displayed
together with the reference field in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_a}. To simplify
the comparison number densities are displayed only where the corresponding
reference or retrieved IWC is larger than $10^{-6}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$.

Comparing the passive-only and the radar-only retrieval to the reference field
shows that both methods have little to no skill in predicting number density
concentrations. Although the passive-only retrieval partly captures the
gradient between very high concentrations at the top of the cloud and the low
concentrations at the bottom, it is not at all resolved in the radar-only
retrieval. The combined retrieval, however, manages to reproduce this gradient
in some parts of the scene. Although its exact structure is not fully
reproduced, this clearly shows sensitivity of the retrievals to particle number
concentrations.

The combined retrieval shows the strongest deviations from the reference field
between $2$ and $3\unit{^\circ}$ latitude. Here, the results strongly
underestimate the true number concentrations. Comparison with the cloud
composition displayed in Panel (a) of Fig.~\ref{fig:overview} shows that this
region contains large amounts of both cloud ice and snow. Since the retrieval
uses only a single hydrometeor species to represent ice in the atmosphere it is
not able to represent such heterogeneous conditions. Since snow will have the
stronger impact on the observations, the retrieval in these regions tends to
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{predict }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{represent }\DIFaddend snow rather than ice, which leads to the low retrieved number densities.

To further investigate this, Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_scatter_a} displays
scatter plots of the reference and retrieved number density concentrations for
all three methods and two particle models from the first test scene. Markers in
the plot are color coded according to their homogeneity in the reference scene,
here defined as the ratio of the maximum mass density of any of the frozen
hydrometeor species and total IWC. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.7\textwidth]{figures/fig12}
\caption{Reference and retrieved particle number concentrations of frozen
  hydrometeors for the first test scene obtained with the LargePlateAggregate
  particle model. Panel (a) displays the reference mass concentrations from the
  model scene. Panel (b), (c) and (d) display the retrieval results for the
  passive-only, radar-only and combined retrieval. Only values for which the corresponding
  reference or retrieved IWC was larger than  $10^{-6}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$ are shown here.}
\label{fig:results_nd_a}
\end{figure}

These results confirm that the passive-only retrieval possesses certain
sensitivity to the particle number density since the cluster at low reference
number densities corresponding to snow is placed correctly on the diagonal. The
radar-only retrieval does not exhibit any retrieval skill, hardly reproducing
any of the variation of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{references }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reference }\DIFaddend values. Contrary to this, the combined
retrieval moves both clusters towards the diagonal, indicating that it is
capable of distinguishing the microphysical properties of cloud ice and snow.
Furthermore, the color coding shows that the strongest deviations between
retrieved and reference number densities occur for grid points where the cloud
composition is heterogeneous. Even for the combined retrieval, however, the
accuracy of a single retrieval value remains fairly low.

The effect of particle shape on the retrieval results is somewhat similar to
what has been observed for IWC. For the passive-only and combined retrieval, the
GemCloudIce model again yields the worst retrieval results, leading to a general
underestimation of the true particle number density. For the radar-only
retrieval no noticeable differences are observed between different particle
models. Only the results for the GemCloudIce and LargePlateAggregate particle
models are shown here since the results for the other particles are mostly similar
to those obtained with the LargePlateAggregate model.

\begin{figure}

  color encodes the homogeneity of the corresponding ice mass, which is computed
  as the ratio of the maximum mass density of any of the frozen hydrometeor
  species and total IWC.}
\label{fig:results_nd_scatter_a}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Information content}

The retrieval results presented above show that the combined observations allow
a more accurate retrieval of both mass and particle number density. This
confirms the experimental results from Sec.~\ref{sec:simple_cloud}, that active
and passive observations provide complementary information on the microphysics
of ice particles. The information content of the retrievals can be assessed more
quantitatively using the averaging kernel matrix. The trace of the AVK, commonly
referred to as the number of degrees of freedom for signal (DFS), quantifies the
number of independent pieces of information contained in the observations.

The distributions of the degrees of freedom of each retrieved profile in the
test scenes are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:dofs}. Not-surprisingly, the combined
observations exhibit the highest information content. Nevertheless, comparison
with the DFS values of the active- and passive-only retrieval shows that the
observations contain a certain degree of redundancy leading to a lower combined
DFS value than the direct sum of the two.

The grouping into retrieval quantities furthermore reveals that the largest
increase in the information content comes from water vapor, which is not
retrieved in the radar-only retrieval. Although small, a significant increase in
information content is observed for both scenes for the $N_0^*$ parameter for
ice hydrometeors. Interestingly, this increase is observed even though the
information content in the passive-only observations for $N_0^*$ is close to
zero. For the $D_m$ parameter, a small decrease is observed with respect to the
radar-only retrieval for both scenes. Since the calculation of the AVK involves
the forward model Jacobian, this effect must be related to the non-linearity of
the forward model.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width = 0.7\textwidth]{figures/fig14}

  the top of bars mark the extent of one standard deviation around the mean of
  each distribution.}
\label{fig:dofs}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Impact of assumed ice particle shape}



To further investigate the effect of the assumed ice particle shape on the
retrieval results, the mass density relations for the tested particle models are
displayed in Panel~(a) of Fig.~\ref{fig:costs}. As can be seen from this plot,
the GemCloudIce particle clearly stands out due to its large mass. Except for
the fact that the GemSnow particle does not reach down to small particle sizes,
the remaining particle models have quite similar in mass-size relations. The
extreme density of the GemCloudIce particle model for large particle sizes likely
explains the bad performance observed in the results presented above. Similarly,
the bad performance of the GemSnow model in terms of retrieved IWC and IWP is likely
due to it not covering small particle sizes.

Also displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:costs} (panel (b) and (c)) are the $\chi^2_y$
values of the combined retrieval obtained for the tested particle models. Since
the particle shape has considerable effect on sub-millimeter observations
\citep{ekelund19}, one could hope that the retrieval results can be used to
infer the prevailing ice particle type based on the how well the retrieval can
fit the observations. Unfortunately, such clear conclusions cannot be drawn from
the results. In the first test scene, the best fit is obtained by the GemSnow,
GemCloudIce and the LargePlateAggregate particle models, although the GemSnow
and GemCloudIce models quite clearly yield the worst retrieval performance. For
the second scene, similar results are observed. Here, the GemSnow particle
consistently gives the lowest $\chi^2_y$ value but comparison with
Fig.~\ref{fig:boxes} clearly shows that it does not yield the best retrieval
performance.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Humidity and cloud water}

The developed passive and combined retrieval algorithms also retrieve profiles
of humidity and liquid cloud mass density. For relative humidity, both
retrievals demonstrate sensitivity but no improvement could be observed in the
results of the combined retrieval compared to the passive-only retrieval.
Moreover, no suitable retrieval setup was found within the scope of this study
which would yield throughout satisfactory performance. Since we do not consider
our results representative of what could be achieved with the observational
approach, they are not included here.

The liquid cloud retrieval, however, revealed an additional synergy of the radar
and passive microwave observations. The retrieval results are therefore shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:results_cw_b} to serve as a preview for potential additional
applications of the combined retrieval approach. Panel~(a) of the figure shows
the reference and retrieved column-integrated LWC, here referred to as liquid
water path (LWP). Although the total LWC is still underestimated, the combined
observations clearly improve the LWP retrieval in all regions except those covered
by thick clouds.

Panel (b) displays the reference LWC drawn as contours on top of the total
hydrometeor content. Panel (c) and (d) show the retrieved LWC drawn on top of
the retrieved IWC for the passive-only and the combined retrieval. These results
show clearly that the combined retrieval is able to detect and retrieve liquid
clouds even when they overlap with ice clouds. Although some sensitivity of the
passive-only retrieval to LWC can be observed as well, the retrieval puts the
cloud too high in the troposphere and underestimates its LWC. This indicates
that the radar reflectivity profile contains useful information for the
retrieval to better locate cloud water in the atmospheric column.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The principal aim of this study was to investigate the synergies between radar
and passive sub-millimeter observations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the retrieval of frozen
hydrometeors}\DIFaddend . To this end, a simplified numerical experiment has been presented,
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that qualitatively }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which }\DIFaddend demonstrates the existence of complementary information in the radar and
passive microwave observations. Furthermore, a combined retrieval algorithm has
been developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the synergistic retrievals and
further explore their potential as well as current limitations.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The novelty of this work lies, for one part, in the application of ICI's
sub-millimeter channels, which sets it apart from the combined retrievals
developed for the TRMM and GPM missions. For the other part, it lies in the
development of a fully-consistent variational retrieval in which all retrieval
quantities are retrieved from the observations from all sensors simultaneously.
This allows comparing the retrieval to equivalent radar-only and passive-only
configurations and therefore a direct analysis of the synergies between the
active and passive observations.
}

\DIFaddend \subsection{Fundamental synergies}

The experiment presented in the first part of this study aimed to establish the
fundamental synergies of the active and passive microwave observations. It
compared the cloud signals observed by a radar, a millimeter-wave radiometer and
a sub-millimeter-wave radiometer. The results show that the combined
observations can simultaneously constrain the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{horizontal and vertical scaling of
the particle size distribution}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{size and concentration of
particles in the cloud}\DIFaddend . However, the complementary information content between
the active and passive observations depends on both the properties of the
observed cloud and the frequency of the observations. For the lower frequencies
considered in this study, i.e. the highest channels of the MWI radiometer, the
regions where both observations provide complementary information on the
particle size distribution of the cloud are limited to very high mass densities
and particle sizes. It should be noted, however, that since the radar
simulations neglect multiple scattering, the results are likely less accurate in
this region of the cloud-parameter space. As the passive observing frequency
increases, the regions of complementary information content extend down to
smaller particle sizes and cloud mass density. Especially the highest-frequency
channels of the ICI radiometer can therefore be expected to provide additional
information on the particle size distribution of ice clouds.

\subsection{Combined cloud retrieval}

In the second part of the study, we have presented results from a combined,
variational cloud retrieval applied to synthetic observations from two test
scenes from a high-resolution atmosphere model. The results of the combined
retrieval were compared to that of a passive- and a radar-only version of the
retrieval algorithm. The simulated observations neglected potential errors
caused by different or non-overlapping antenna beams as well as inhomogeneity of
the atmosphere across the beams. On the other hand, a source of forward model
error was included by applying a more complex microphysics scheme in the
simulations than the one used in the retrieval. This allows assessing the
retrieval error caused by the simplified modeling of cloud microphysics in the
retrieval.

\subsubsection{Retrieval performance}

Of the three considered retrieval implementations, the passive-only retrieval
clearly performs worst in terms of retrieved IWC. It should be noted, however,
that the passive only retrieval presented here has not been fully optimized and
should therefore not be taken as representative of the potential performance of
the MWI and ICI radiometers for IWC retrievals. To ensure a fair comparison, the
retrieval uses almost the same a priori assumptions as the other two retrievals,
which in the presented case provide only very limited information on the
vertical structure of the cloud. As has been shown also by other studies, the
passive observations do provide information on the vertical distribution of ice
in the atmospheric column \citep{wang17, grutzun18}, but the information content
is limited to a few degrees of freedom. It is therefore unlikely that the
vertical resolution of the passive-only retrieval can be improved drastically
without further constraining it a priori, as it is typically done in retrievals
that use Monte Carlo integration or neural networks \citep{pfreundschuh18}.

With respect to IWP, however, the passive retrieval can perform as well or even
better than the radar-only and the combined retrieval. Furthermore, the results
in Figure~\ref{fig:results_nd_a} indicate that the passive observations provide
some information on the particle number concentrations, which is not the case
for the radar observations. This in itself is an interesting result as it shows
that even when considered separately, observations from active and passive
microwave sensors should be considered complementary to each other in their
information content.

As expected, the radar-only retrieval provides much better IWC retrievals than
the passive-only version. However, the results exhibit systematic deviations
from the reference values in certain regions of the cloud. The analysis of the
retrieval performance shown in Figure~\ref{fig:results_scatter_a_1},
\ref{fig:results_scatter_a_2} and \ref{fig:results_scatter_b_1} revealed that
these are caused by systematic errors in the retrieval of specific hydrometeor
species from the GEM model. A likely explanation for this is that the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend priori
assumptions applied in the retrieval do not fit the specific microphysical
properties of the species in the model. This hypothesis is confirmed by the
radar-retrieved number density fields shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_a} and
Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_scatter_a}. While the reference distribution has two
modes corresponding to ice and snow, the retrieved values are nearly the same
throughout the whole scene. Viewed from an information content perspective, this
is plausible since the radar provides only one piece of independent information
at each range gate, which is insufficient to determine the two degrees of
freedom ($N_0^*$ and $D_m$) of the PSD. The information on the second degree of
freedom must therefore come from the a priori assumptions.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The a priori assumptions which were used in this study were similar but not
identical to what is used in the DARDAR retrievals. Also here it should be
noted, that the presented results should not be taken to be representative for
the DARDAR product. Rather than this, the DARDAR a priori settings were chosen
since they represent well established and validated assumptions for ice cloud
retrievals and therefore should provide a reasonable starting point for the
development of a combined cloud retrieval. The fact that the a priori
assumptions used in the DARDAR retrieval do not agree with the microphysical
properties of ice and snow in the GEM model, does not say much about the general
validity of these assumptions.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Despite the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Despite }\DIFaddend certain visible artifacts in the retrieved IWC field (Fig.
\ref{fig:results_a}), the analysis of the results of the combined retrieval
presented in Figs.~\ref{fig:results_scatter_a_1} , \ref{fig:results_scatter_a_2}
and in particular \ref{fig:boxes} shows that it yields, at least for most of the
tested particle models, the best retrieval performance for IWC and IWP. The
benefit of the combined observations is even more pronounced in the retrieved
number density fields (Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_a}). Here, the passive- and
radar-only retrieval showed little to no skill in retrieving the particle number
concentrations. The combined retrieval, however, was able to reproduce the
general structure of the number concentration fields in regions where the cloud
composition is homogeneous (Fig.~\ref{fig:results_nd_scatter_a}). In particular
this \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{showed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shows }\DIFaddend that the combined retrieval is able to distinguish the microphysical
properties of ice and snow in the model. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Instead of relying on the a priori,
the combined retrieval can use information from the observations to constrain the
cloud microphysics, which avoids the systematic errors observed in the radar-only
retrievals.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The a priori assumptions used in this study are based on the DARDAR-CLOUD
product, since they represent well established and validated assumptions for ice
cloud retrievals. The role of the a priori is to complement the observations
with additional information required to make the retrieval problem tractable.
For the hydrometeor retrieval this means that the a priori determines how the
information from the observations, which alone is insufficient to accurately
determine both degrees of freedom of the PSD, is distributed between its $D_m$
and $N_0^*$ parameters. For the radar-only retrieval, this works well for cloud
systems containing both ice and snow but leads to biased retrievals in both IWC
and IWP when this is not the case, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:results_boxes}.
These problems could be remedied by introducing more specific a priori
assumptions. However, these will depend on the cloud or hydrometeor type
imposing the question of how these can be determined a priori. For the combined
retrieval, however, this may not be necessary since the increased information
content makes it less dependent on the a priori to infer the microphysical
properties of the cloud.
}

\DIFaddend \subsubsection{Impact of the assumed particle shape}

Although the combined retrieval can reduce systematic errors in the retrieved
IWC and IWP, its performance can even degrade if an unrealistic particle habit
is used, as observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:boxes}. In general, the passive-only and
the combined retrievals display stronger sensitivity to the assumed particle shape
than the radar-only retrieval. This is plausible since the increased sensitivity
especially of the sub-millimeter radiometer channels has been highlighted
in several studies \citep{ekelund19a, fox19}.

Given the increased sensitivity of the passive-only and combined retrieval to
the assumed particle shape, it would be desirable to know which of the
properties of a particle model are most critical for its representativeness. Five
different particle models were tested here: The two most dominant from
the GEM model and three additional models taken from the ARTS SSDB. The two GEM
particles both showed the worst retrieval performance. For the GemCloudIce model, a
likely explanation for its bad performance is its very high density. The GemSnow model
has similar density as the 8-ColumnAggregate, but does not reach down to small
particle sizes, possibly explaining why it is unsuitable for the retrieval.
Nonetheless, small performance differences are observed also for the other three
models, but no clear connection to their mass-size relation can be established.
This indicates that also its specific scattering properties are important factors
that determine representativeness of a particle model.

Furthermore, it has been briefly investigated whether the goodness of the fit to
the observations can provide information on the suitability of the chosen
particle model. In particular, we aimed to address the question whether the
combined observations can constrain the dominant particle shape or whether a
good fit to the observations can be obtained regardless of the applied particle
model. Unfortunately, no evidence of a relation between the $\chi^2_y$ value and
the retrieval performance was observed. It thus remains an open question whether
and how information on the ice particle shape can be extracted from microwave
observations of ice particles.

\subsubsection{Humidity and cloud water}

As an outlook, we have also included results from the liquid cloud retrieval,
that clearly shows its capability to retrieve liquid cloud mass densities even
within mixed-phase clouds. Although certain sensitivity to cloud water is
observed also for the passive-only retrieval, the addition of the radar signal
clearly improved the localization of the cloud in the atmosphere. This explains
the observed improvement in the retrieved LWP, since at lower altitude a thicker
cloud is required to yield the same passive cloud signal. This shows that
combined radar and microwave radiometer observations can also be used for the
profiling of warm and supercooled liquid clouds.

Although no satisfactory results were obtained from the water vapor retrieval,
the retrieval results still indicate sensitivity of this setup for retrieving
atmospheric humidity. The full exploration of the potential of the combined
observations for liquid cloud and water vapor is out of the scope of this study
and is left to future investigation.

\subsubsection{Retrieval method}

The combined retrieval implementation showed robust performance on fairly
distinct and complex cloud scenes. Despite this, both scenes that were
considered here contained parts where the OEM minimization did not find a state
that results in a good fit to the observations. In contrast to that, the
radar-only retrieval did converge well in most regions where the final cost of
the combined retrieval remained high. The inability of the retrieval to fit the
observations indicates additional information that is contained in the combined
observations but which the retrieval method cannot disentangle. Furthermore, the
results exhibit visible profile-to-profile variability as well as some artifacts
in the form of high-frequency vertical oscillation. We have tried to counteract
these by increasing the vertical spatial correlation but to no avail.

This raises the question of the suitability of the OEM method applied here. The
combined retrieval violates the two fundamental assumptions of the OEM method:
The forward model is non-linear and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the assumed }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{it is difficult to describe the variability
of cloud parameters using }\DIFaddend Gaussian a priori assumptions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{do
not describe reality very well}\DIFdelend . In addition to that,
the current implementation of the retrieval is computationally very expensive.
For further development of the combined retrieval concept it may therefore be
advisable to revisit the applied retrieval method in search for a potentially
more suitable alternative.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Some of the above-mentioned problems could likely be counteracted by accounting
for the forward model error caused by the simplified forward model applied in
the retrieval. However, finding an accurate description of this error
would require developing a suitable model for it which was deemed out of the
this studies' scope.
}

\DIFaddend \subsubsection{Limitations}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, it is important to consider the
limitations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{An important limitation }\DIFaddend of this study \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is its scope: The aim here was not to develop
a production-ready combined retrieval product but rather a proof-of-concept to
explore the observational approach. The retrieval }\DIFaddend results presented here \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{should
therefore not be interpreted in absolute terms. The primary results are based on
the relative performances of the three retrieval methods: Given equivalent a
priori assumptions, the combined retrieval demonstrates higher sensitivity to
the microphysical properties than the radar-only retrieval and lower errors
in terms of IWC than the passive-only retrieval.
}

\DIFadd{Another limiting factor of this study are that it is }\DIFaddend purely based on simulations
and restricted to two selected model test scenes. The validity of the presented
results thus \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to some extent
}\DIFdelend depends on how well cloud microphysics are represented in GEM
model. While this may \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{affect the specific }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{again affect the absolute }\DIFaddend performance results for the
tested retrieval methods, the main findings of this work \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, namely that the combined retrieval shows greater
sensitivity to the microphysical properties of ice hydrometeors than the radar-
or passive-only retrievals, }\DIFdelend should be independent
of the realism of the test scenes.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Furthermore, the forward simulations used to generate the synthetic observations
do not consider beam filling issues, assume a slightly unrealistic viewing
geometry and neglect multiple scattering in the radar simulations. For a
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{It should also be noted that this study does not provide a }\DIFaddend realistic assessment
of the potential \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{retrieval performance this should
certainly be taken into account . Again, it is important to understand the
results presented here as a study of the fundamental synergies of active and
passive microwave observationsrather than an accurate performance assessment of
the combined retrieval}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of a space-borne satellite mission involving ICI, MWI and a
W-band. For this it would be necessary to take into account a more realistic
viewing geometry, beam-filling errors as well as multiple scattering in
the radar observations}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdel{The results presented in this study }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our results }\DIFaddend particularly highlight the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{complementarity
of the active and passive observations
: Although the radar provides observations at high vertical resolution, they contain insufficient information on the microphysical properties of hydrometeors. The passive-only observations, on the
contrary, have low vertical resolution, but are more sensitive to cloud
microphysics allowing a potentially more accurate IWP retrieval than what can be
obtained from the radar alone. A synergistic retrieval using both types of observations allows combining the high vertical resolution of
the radar with the
sensitivity to cloud microphysics of the passive observations, which
yields more accurate retrievals of IWC, IWP and particle number densities}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{importance of sub-millimeter observations
for combined retrievals of frozen hydrometeors. While observations at currently
available microwave frequencies provide only complementary information only for
thick clouds with very large particles ($D_m > 800\ \unit{\mu m}, \text{IWC} >
10^{-4}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$) to the radar observations, it is mainly the
frequencies above $200\ \unit{GHz}$ that provide additional information on cloud
microphysics (Fig.~\ref{contours}) at smaller particles sizes and water content
($D_m > 200\ \unit{\mu m}, \text{IWC} > 10^{-5}\ \unit{kg\ m^{-3}}$).
}

\DIFadd{Moreover it has been found that the combination of radar and passive microwave
observations may help the retrieval of mixed-phase clouds. Since the role of
these clouds in the climate of the arctic are an active topic of study, the use
of combined sub-mm/radar observations should be further investigated}\DIFaddend .

Synergistic retrievals from active and passive microwave observations ideally
complement currently available observation systems that combine radar with
observations in the visible or infrared. The advantage of combined microwave
observations is that they provide sensitivity throughout the whole cloud, where
visible and infrared observations would be saturated. Where only information
from the radar is available, a retrieval based on optical or infrared
observations has to rely on a priori assumptions, which may cause similar
systematic errors as what has been observed in this study. In addition to this,
our results underline the benefits of ICI's sub-millimeter channels, which
significantly improve the sensitivity of the passive observations to smaller
particle sizes and mass densities and thus narrow the sensitivity gap between
the observing frequencies of traditional microwave imagers and observations in
the infrared and visible domain.

The upcoming launch of the ICI and MWI radiometers thus provides a great
opportunity for a potential synergistic cloud-radar \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{missions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mission}\DIFaddend . Such a mission
would have a unique scientific value for the study of frozen hydrometeors
because of its ability to better determine the microphysical properties of
hydrometeors even inside of thick clouds. Since such information is currently
simply not available at a global scale, such a mission would be valuable not
only in itself but also for other earth observation systems by establishing more
reliable a priori assumptions on cloud microphysics.

The results presented in this study not only show the potential of the combined
retrieval approach but also demonstrate its feasibility. Although further work
will be required to fully understand the effect of particle shape and PSD, the
concept is mature enough to be applied to real observations. Since airborne
demonstrators of sub-millimeter radiometers are available already today, the
combined retrievals could be applied in future field campaigns to study ice
cloud microphysics.

Overall, the combined active and passive microwave retrievals are a promising
concept that deserves further exploration. Regardless whether airborne or
spaceborne, combined active and passive microwave observations have great
potential to improve the understanding of the microphysical properties of ice
hydrometeors.

results are qualitatively very similar to those of the first scene. Also here,
the final OEM cost, shown in Panel~(a), displays a region of increased cost for
the passive-only and combined retrievals. This is again a region of very dense
cloud which consists of graupel and snow. Also similar to the first scene, the
passive only retrieval does not reproduce the structure of the cloud well.
Although the cloud top is placed at the right position, neither the vertical
structure of the cloud nor its base are resolved. The radar-only retrieval
resolves the vertical structure of the cloud well, but overestimates the ice
mass density in the scene. The combined retrieval also resolves the vertical
structure of the cloud well and corrects the overestimation observed in the
